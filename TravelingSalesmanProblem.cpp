5. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Given a set of cities and distances between them, find the shortest possible route
that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Sample Result

Input:  graph = {{0, 50, 30, 25},
                {50, 0, 40, 10},
                {30, 40, 0, 15},
                {25, 10, 15, 0}}

Output: Approximate shortest route length: 70
